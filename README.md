# Graduate-Admissions-Prediction
The main aim of this project is to predict the possibility of getting an admit into graduate university on the basis of some parameters.

Here, I have implemented two major ML models - Linear Regression and KNN Regression.

At the end, it will tell which model works best for this dataset on the basis of minimal errors.
